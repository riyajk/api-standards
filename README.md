## Mock Responses
It is suggested that each resource accept a 'mock' parameter on the testing server. Passing this parameter should return a mock data response (bypassing the backend).

Implementing this feature early in development ensures that the API will exhibit consistent behavior, supporting a test driven development methodology.

Note: If the mock parameter is included in a request to the production environment, an error should be raised.


## JSONP

JSONP is easiest explained with an example. Here's one from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about?answertab=votes#tab-top):

> Say you're on domain abc.com, and you want to make a request to domain xyz.com. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland.

> The one item that bypasses this limitation is `<script>` tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really DO anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.

> Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

> For example, say the server expects a parameter called "callback" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:

>         http://www.xyz.com/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback

> Without JSONP, this might return some basic javascript object, like so:

>         { foo: 'bar' }

> However, with JSONP, when the server receives the "callback" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:

>         mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });

> As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:

>         mycallback = function(data){
>             alert(data.foo);
>         };
